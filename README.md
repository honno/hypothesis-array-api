# Hypothesis strategies for Array API libraries

**Note:** `hypothesis-array-api` uses private APIs from Hypothesis
and so should be considered unstable.

## Install

You can get the strategies from PyPI.

```bash
pip install hypothesis-array-api
```

To install from source,
[get Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
and then `poetry install` inside the repository.
Using `poetry shell` is a good idea for development,
where you can use `pytest` to run the full test suite
(note there a lot of expected warnings I need to declutter.)

## Quickstart

```python
from numpy import array_api as xp

from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis_array import get_strategies_namespace

xpst = get_strategies_namespace(xp)

@given(xpst.arrays(dtype=xpst.scalar_strategies(), shape=xpst.array_shapes()))
def your_test(array):
    ...
```

## Contributors

[@honno](https://github.com/honno/) created these strategies
with input from
[@mattip](https://github.com/mattip),
[@asmeurer](https://github.com/asmeurer),
[@rgommers](https://github.com/rgommers)
and other great folk from
[@Quansight-Labs](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs).

Great inspiration was taken from the
[NumPy strategies](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/numpy.html#numpy)
that Hypothesis ships with at `hypothesis.extra.numpy`.
