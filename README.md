# Hypothesis strategies for Array API libraries

Note that just like `hypothesis-array-api` this README is very much subject to change!

To install from source,
[get Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
and then `poetry install` inside the repository.
Using `poetry shell` first is a good idea for development,
where you can use `pytest` to run the full test suite
(note there a lot of expected warnings I need to declutter.)
